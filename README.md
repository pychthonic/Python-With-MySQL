# Python-With-MySQL

This program asks the user to input a list of cities, and
uses http requests to find the driving distance from each 
city to all the other cities input by the user. It then
conntects to a MYSQL database, asking the user for ip
address, username and password for said database, then
once inside, creates a table in the mysql database for
all this information, prints it to the screen, deletes
the database, and exits.


Here is a screenshot of it running. The user inputs 6
cities.
